#  Hso

A tool to help colorblind people gain full color discrimination.

It is currently adapted for protanopia only. (Because I am protanopia. I hope that other kinds of color blind people will contact me to help adjust the algorithm.)

*In Chinese,“hso” stands for “very colorful”.*

## What this application do?

1. First apply common-use colorblind correction filter ([source](https://gist.github.com/jcdickinson/580b7fb5cc145cee8740)).
2. Add visual hint for red, a scan line that converts purple and red to green and yellow to blue.
3. Add visual hint for green, overlay stripes on top of green ([source](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XlSSRz)).
